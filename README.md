## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- VITE
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project has taught me and helped me practice how to work with Context API and creating and using custom hooks.

### Continued development

Still learning React and Redux, I would have love to store all the states using Modern Redux Toolkit and I think i would use it to store states in my first big projectðŸ˜Š

### Useful resources

- [Code magic](https://code-magic.vercel.app/). It really helped me when i struggled to give the unchecked todo circle a gradient border color on hover state. It was a very helpful because i just had to input the different colors then it generated the css code which i used.
